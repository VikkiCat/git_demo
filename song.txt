I feel like fallin' in love (fallin' love)
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up (tonight, I'm fuckin' somethin' up, baby)
I need some drink in my cup (I need a drink)
Hey (pour me a drink)
I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up (I'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up)
I wanna go missin'
I need a prescription
I wanna go higher, can I sit on top of you? (Ooh-la-la-la, la-la-la)
I wanna go where nobody's been (wanna go where nobody's been)
Have you ever had fun like this? (Have you ever had fun? Yeah)
